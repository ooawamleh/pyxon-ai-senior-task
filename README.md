## Task Requirements

Your task is to demonstrate **agentic AI** skills by building one or more agents that use **external data sources** and an **LLM** to answer user questions. You may use **LangChain** (and related packages such as **LangGraph**) or another framework of your choice.

### 1. Agent with Search / Data Source (e.g., Google)

Build an **agent that has access to a data source such as Google Search** and uses an LLM to answer questions based on that data.

- The agent should be able to **query the data source** (e.g., run search queries).
- The agent should **consume the returned content** (snippets, links, or full pages) and use the **LLM** to synthesize an answer.
- Optionally, combine with **RAG**: persist search results (or fetched pages) into a vector store and use retrieval before generation for better grounding and citations.

**Does LangChain support this?** Yes. LangChain provides:

- **Google Search:** e.g. `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper` (requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`). You can expose it as a tool and use it with an agent.
- **Agent + tools:** Use `load_tools(["google-search"], llm=llm)` and an agent (e.g. ReAct) so the LLM decides when to search and how to use results to answer.

You are free to use another search provider (e.g., SerpAPI, Bing, Tavily) if you prefer.

### 2. Agent That Requests URLs and Processes Them (e.g., APIs / Web Pages)

Build an **agent that can make HTTP requests to URLs**, process the response (e.g., HTML or JSON from an API), **understand what is there**, and use that information to **answer user questions**.

- The agent should be able to **call URLs** (GET and, if useful, POST) and get response content.
- The agent should **interpret** the content (e.g., parse JSON, extract text from HTML) and feed it to the LLM.
- The LLM should use this content to **answer questions** or perform tasks (e.g., “What does this API return?” or “Summarize the content at this URL”).

**Does LangChain support this?** Yes. LangChain provides:

- **Requests tools:** e.g. `RequestsGetTool` (GET a URL and return response text). Load via `load_tools(["requests_all"], allow_dangerous_requests=True)` (opt-in for security). Similar tools exist for POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE.
- You can also build **custom tools** that call `requests` or `httpx`, parse JSON/HTML, and return a string for the LLM.

Use these (or custom tools) inside an agent so the LLM decides which URLs to call and how to use the responses.

### 3. Agent Swarm (Multi-Agent System) with LangChain / LangGraph

Create an **agent swarm** (multi-agent system) using **LangChain** (and optionally **LangGraph**).

- **Multiple agents** with distinct roles (e.g., one for search, one for URL fetching, one for synthesis or coding).
- **Coordination:** agents can hand off tasks, use each other as tools, or be orchestrated by a router/supervisor.
- **Data flow:** ensure that data from external sources (search, URLs/APIs) is used by the swarm to answer user questions.

**Does LangChain/LangGraph support this?** Yes. LangGraph provides:

- **Multi-agent patterns:** subagents, handoffs, router, or custom workflows.
- **Swarm-style coordination:** e.g. `langgraph-swarm` with `create_swarm()` for multiple agents (graphs) working together.
- **Examples:** multi-agent collaboration, multi-agent networks (e.g., inspired by AutoGen-style designs).

Your swarm should demonstrate at least one of: search-backed answers, URL/API-backed answers, or a clear division of labor (e.g., researcher + writer + critic).

---

## Deliverables

Provide the following in your submission:

1. **Working code** for:
   - An agent that uses a search/data source (e.g., Google) + LLM to answer questions, and/or  
   - An agent that requests URLs (and optionally APIs), processes the content, and uses the LLM to answer, and/or  
   - An agent swarm (multi-agent system) that uses external data (search and/or URLs) and an LLM to answer questions.

2. **One full end-to-end example** (script or notebook) that:
   - Takes a **user question** (e.g., “What is the current weather in Amman?” or “Summarize the content at https://example.com” or “What does the API at https://api.example.com/status return?”).
   - Uses your agent(s) to **fetch data** (search and/or URL/API).
   - **Processes** the data (parse, optionally store in a vector store for RAG).
   - Uses the **LLM** to produce a clear **answer** (and optionally citations/sources).

3. **README** (or section in a README) that explains:
   - How to run the code (dependencies, env vars, e.g. `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`, LLM API keys).
   - Architecture: which agents/tools you used, how data flows from search/URLs to the LLM.
   - One or two example questions and the expected behavior (or sample outputs).

4. **Optional but valued:**
   - Simple **RAG** integration (e.g., index search results or URL content in a vector store, then retrieve before generating).
   - **Tests** or a small **benchmark** (e.g., a few fixed Q&A pairs) to verify behavior.
   - **Docker** or **Kubernetes/Helm** outline for running the agent in a container or cluster (aligned with the role’s deployment focus).

## Full Example Outline (Reference)

Below is a **minimal structure** for a single agent that uses **Google Search** and **URL fetching** to answer questions. You can extend this into a swarm or add RAG.

```python
# Example structure (pseudocode – adapt to your preferred LangChain/LangGraph APIs)

# 1. Tools
# - Google Search: GoogleSearchAPIWrapper or load_tools(["google-search"], llm=llm)
# - URL fetch: RequestsGetTool or load_tools(["requests_all"], allow_dangerous_requests=True)
# - Optional: custom tool that GETs a URL, parses JSON/HTML, returns a string

# 2. Agent
# - Create an agent (e.g. create_react_agent or AgentExecutor) with tools = [search_tool, requests_tool]
# - System message: "You can search the web and fetch URLs. Use the results to answer the user's question."

# 3. Run
# - user_question = "What is the latest news about X?" or "What does https://api.example.com/info return?"
# - result = agent.invoke({"input": user_question})
# - Print result["output"] and, if available, citations/sources
```

**LangChain/LangGraph references (as of 2024):**

- **Google Search:** [LangChain Google Search integration](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/google_search/)  
- **Requests (URL fetch):** [LangChain Requests tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/requests/) (use `allow_dangerous_requests=True` where required)  
- **Multi-agent / swarm:** [LangGraph multi-agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/multi-agent/), [LangGraph Swarm](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/swarm/)  
- **RAG:** LangChain retrieval chains and vector stores (e.g., from document loaders or from fetched URL content)

You may implement in **Python** with **LangChain/LangGraph** or another framework (e.g., LlamaIndex, custom orchestration); the above is a suggested path that matches the “LangChain agent with Google + URL requests” idea.

## Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python preferred (per role).
- **Frameworks:** LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or equivalent agent/RAG frameworks.
- **LLM:** Any compatible model (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.); specify in README.
- **Search:** Google Search API (or SerpAPI, Tavily, Bing, etc.).
- **URL/HTTP:** `requests` or `httpx`; LangChain’s Requests tools or custom tools.
- **Optional:** Vector store (Chroma, FAISS, etc.) for RAG; Docker/K8s for deployment.

### Security and Safety

- Do **not** hardcode API keys; use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- If using `requests_all` or similar, be aware of the security implications (arbitrary URL fetch); use `allow_dangerous_requests` only where necessary and document it.
- For deployment, consider network policies, private endpoints, and least-privilege access (aligned with the role’s security and compliance focus).
